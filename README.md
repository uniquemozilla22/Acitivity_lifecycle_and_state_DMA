# Activity-lifecycle-and-state
In this practical you add to the TwoActivities app. The app looks and behaves roughly the same as it did in the last codelab. It contains two Activity implementations and gives the user the ability to send between them. The changes you make to the app in this practical will not affect its visible user behavior.
